Unless specified elsewhere, I do not intend to submit these.

If you want to do so, you can use my templates as a base to create your own for submission to void-packages.
Just notify me, preferably per email (this is purely so I may notice, this is in no way a requirement to use anything).


This repository mostly contains templates which I need but upstream does not contain and/or things to test.
