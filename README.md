# 123randomuser321_void_templates
Unless specified elsewhere, I do not intend to submit these.

If you want to do so, you can use my templates as a base to create your own for submission to void-packages.
Just notify me, preferably per email (this is purely so I may notice, this is in no way a requirement to use anything).



Currently existing templates:


- amdgpu-pro-wip (heavily wip)

- amf-headers (Needed by FFMPEG etc to enable VCE HW-Encoding)

- citra (manual editing needed) (bad, will be reworked)

- fre:ac (written as freac; plus its deps smooth and BoCA, and their -devel pkgs)

- makemkv (meta, -bin, -oss, -libaacs)
