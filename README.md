# 123randomuser321_void_templates
Unless specified elsewhere, I do not intend to submit these.

If you want to do so, you can use my templates as a base to create your own for submission to void-packages.
Just credit me (i.e. 'original template by 123randomuser321 <labmailssadur@gmail.com>') somewhere in the template and notify me, preferably per email. You do not need my explicit permission to use these, so be my guest.
